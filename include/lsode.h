** LSODE is an Adams method.
** n = number of equations.
** time = initial time.
** y = pointer to your array of n state variables.
** f = function of yours that computes ydot
** stiff_flag: 0 = no, 1 = yes.  No dynamic decision like SDRIV2.
** eps = allowable relative error.
** zero = "problem zero"; I think it's allowable absolute error.
**
** WARNING: although you can have multiple invokations of the integrator
** running using this interface, each time you switch which LSODE "object"
** you're integrating, there is some restart overhead.  So, it's quite a bit
** more efficient to do a bunch of LSODE integrations in series than in
** parallel.
