 ** LLFILE: files whose length can be as long as the maximum "long long" int,
 ** which currently under gcc is 64 bits.
 **
 ** I assume that you'll never try to read or write more than 2GB at once.
 ** This is reasonable assuming your buffer is from a 32-bit address space.
 ** However, any read or write can straddle more than one sub-file (that is,
 ** you can start a large read or write half-way through a subfile, and it'll
 ** transparently stradle any sub-file boundaries necessary to get your operation
 ** done).
 ** This means we can use "size_t" (rather than "long long") as the "size" and
 ** "nitems" parameters to llfread and llfwrite.  However, we do use "long
 ** long"s for llfseek and llftell.
