/*
Heap routines: a smallest-at-top heap.  You also supply a comparison
function.  You allocate a heap using HeapAlloc, and HeapCmp is a pointer
to a function to compare your entries.  HeapAlloc would like a
reasonable guess as to the maximum size the heap will grow, but if you
get it wrong, don't sweat it, these routines will use realloc(3) to
increase the size if needed.  Entries are of type foint (union of int
and void*), see misc.h for details.
